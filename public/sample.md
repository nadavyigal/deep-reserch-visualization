## Creating Your Own Animations

To create your own animations:

1. Use the `container` variable to access the animation container
2. Create HTML elements and append them to the container
3. Use Anime.js to animate these elements
4. Return the animation instance for proper cleanup

## Tips for Great Animations

- Use colors that complement your document
- Consider accessibility - avoid rapid flashing animations
- Test your animations in preview mode
