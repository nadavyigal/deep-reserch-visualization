# Flowchart Enhancement Plan

## Flowchart Enhancement Project

### FLW-v0.1: Initial Reaflow Integration ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Install required dependencies: `reaflow` and `elkjs`
- ‚úÖ Create `ReaflowChart` component as a React component using Next.js standards
- ‚úÖ Integrate Reaflow Chart with existing Mermaid code conversion
- ‚úÖ Create necessary styling for the Reaflow component  
- ‚úÖ Update the FlowchartGenerator to utilize the new Reaflow Chart component
- ‚úÖ Fix React key prop spreading warning in Reaflow components
- ‚úÖ Implement direct node styling to avoid key prop issues
- ‚úÖ Fix infinite update loop in Reaflow components
- ‚úÖ Optimize performance of chart components with useMemo and React.memo
- ‚úÖ Ensure proper CSS for both Reaflow and Mermaid diagrams

### FLW-v0.2: Additional Enhancements üîÑ
- ‚èπÔ∏è Add interactive node editing capabilities 
- ‚èπÔ∏è Implement more customization options (colors, shapes, etc.)
- ‚èπÔ∏è Add ability to save and load flowchart designs
- ‚èπÔ∏è Add export functionality (PNG, SVG, etc.)
- ‚èπÔ∏è Improve error handling with helpful messages
- ‚úÖ Performance optimization for large flowcharts
- ‚úÖ Clean up the code and ensure type safety
- ‚úÖ Add a toggle for classic Mermaid vs. enhanced Reaflow
- ‚úÖ Optimize FlowchartGenerator to show preview-only mode
- ‚úÖ Improve fit-to-container sizing for flowcharts

### FLW-v0.3: Advanced Features ‚èπÔ∏è
- ‚èπÔ∏è Implement drag-and-drop creation for nodes and edges
- ‚èπÔ∏è Add undo/redo functionality
- ‚èπÔ∏è Investigate collaborative editing options
- ‚èπÔ∏è Add animation capabilities for flowchart presentation
- ‚èπÔ∏è Develop template gallery for common flowchart patterns

### Optimizations Completed
- ‚úÖ Fixed React key prop spreading warnings in all components
- ‚úÖ Applied useMemo for data transformations to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- ‚úÖ Implemented React.memo for component memoization
- ‚úÖ Simplified component props and removed unnecessary state
- ‚úÖ Improved parsing efficiency in MermaidCode conversion
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error handling with proper early returns
- ‚úÖ Optimized CSS for better rendering performance
- ‚úÖ Removed redundant animations to improve performance
- ‚úÖ Fixed responsive design for better mobile experience
- ‚úÖ Improved type safety throughout all components
- ‚úÖ Simplified ChartGenerator for better code maintenance
- ‚úÖ Replaced custom UI components with inline SVG icons for reduced dependencies
- ‚úÖ Updated mermaid rendering to use modern Promise-based API
- ‚úÖ Modified FlowchartGenerator to focus on preview-only display
- ‚úÖ Enhanced ReaflowComponents with dynamic zoom based on node count
- ‚úÖ Improved container sizing for better responsive layouts
- ‚úÖ Added smaller node sizes for more compact flowcharts
- ‚úÖ Simplified Canvas configuration to prevent type errors

### Implementation Notes
- The Reaflow library provides a more modern and interactive experience compared to Mermaid
- Supports different node types (circles, diamonds, rectangles)
- Provides automatic layout while still allowing manual adjustments
- Works well with the existing Mermaid-based flowcharts for backward compatibility
- CSS styling ensures a cohesive look and feel with the rest of the application
- Performance optimizations make the flowcharts render smoothly even with complex diagrams
- Preview-only mode enhances user experience by focusing on the visualization
- Dynamic zoom scaling ensures flowcharts fit properly regardless of complexity

### Future Considerations
- Consider building a dedicated flowchart editor page with more advanced capabilities
- Investigate integration with other diagram libraries for specialized chart types
- Explore real-time collaboration features for team-based flowchart creation 
- Add drag-and-drop node editing for intuitive flowchart creation
- Implement printable/exportable flowchart versions for documentation
